//pseudocode
create empty array result

for i from 0 to string length - 1
    for j from i + 1 to string length
        substring = string slice from i to j
        add substring to result

return result

Solution Description:
This algorithm generates all consecutive substrings of a given string.
It uses two nested loops where the outer loop selects the starting index
and the inner loop generates substrings by extending the end index.
Each substring is added to an array in the order they appear.

Example:
Input: "abc"
Output: ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]

Algorithm Type:
Brute-force / Nested iteration approach.

Time Complexity:
O(n²) where n is the length of the input string.

Space Complexity:
O(n²) due to storing all substrings.
